Over the last year, service agents moved quickly to work from their kitchens and living rooms, but relied on legacy technology — disparate, on-premise solutions and spreadsheets — that wasnt designed to manage globally distributed workforces. At the same time, agents were reeling from a monumental surge in the volume of customer requests across all digital channels and new, in-demand experiences like appointment setting and curbside pickup. Today, parts of the world are beginning to reopen — 53 percent of U.S. consumers plan to fly on a plane by the end of this year , and 97 percent plan to shop inside a store .

Many manufacturers continue to rely on antiquated manual systems to edit and update their packaging artwork. Manual processes, such as emailing PDFs and FTP file drops, are time consuming, result in disjointed collaboration, and allow greater room for costly errors, all of which delay time to market. Of nearly 1,000 professionals from 55 countries across all major industries surveyed by Loftware, 88% think having an automated workflow and approval processes for labeling and packaging artwork would shorten time to market.

It’s no coincidence, then, that two themes stood out as Barron’s compiled its 14th annual list of the World’s Best CEOs: cloud savvy and smart acquisitions.” Specifically about Fabrizio, Barron’s wrote, “Fabrizio Freda at Estée Lauder (EL) has pushed a rising portion of his beauty products through high-margin channels, like airport stores and e-commerce sites, growing earnings quickly and attracting a rising price/earnings ratio for the shares.” Elaborating further in the Growth Leaders feature story, Barron’s said, “He invigorated the company with new brands, new markets, and a fresh focus on millennials… Freda, a consumer products marketing whiz... also has acquired small, upstart brands that are disrupting the industry.” The business growth achieved under Fabrizio’s leadership as CEO has gained worldwide attention from investors, analysts, industry peers, top-tier business press and many others. It is an honor to add Barron’s World’s Best CEOs list to the much-deserved recognition of Fabrizio and The Estée Lauder Companies.

These markets continued to evolve in recovery during the fiscal 2023 third quarter, evidenced by strong organic net sales growth in nearly all Asia/Pacific markets. While the Company saw recovery in many markets globally, its Asia travel retail business continued to be pressured by the slower than anticipated recovery from the COVID pandemic. Specifically, in Hainan, while traffic into the island exceeded prior year levels, conversion of travelers to consumers in prestige beauty lagged. This led to the slower than anticipated depletion of elevated levels of retailer inventory and, therefore, lower replenishment orders. 

[^d19a1387a6c4cefa352d887db51f543d]: Beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020, many governments in locations where the Company operates announced programs to assist employers whose businesses were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including programs that provide rebates to incentivize employers to maintain employees on payroll who were unable to work for their usual number of hours.\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company qualified for and recorded $\n12\nmillion, $\n84\nmillion and $\n99\nmillion, respectively, in government assistance, which reduced Selling, general and administrative expenses by $\n9\nmillion, $\n78\nmillion and $\n87\nmillion, respectively, and Cost of sales by $\n3\nmillion, $\n6\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion, respectively. The remaining $\n2\nmillion recorded in fiscal 2020 was deferred and recognized in fiscal 2021 as a reduction to Cost of sales.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIncome Taxes (ASU 2019-12 \u2013 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes)\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(\u201cFASB\u201d)\nissued authoritative guidance that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and making simplifications in other areas.\nEffective for the Company \u2013\nFiscal 2022 first quarter.\nImpact on consolidated financial statements\n\u2013 On July 1, 2021, the Company adopted this standard and recorded a cumulative adjustment of $\n121\nmillion\nas an\nincrease to its fiscal 2022 opening retained earnings balance to derecognize a deferred tax liability related to a previously held equity method investment that became a foreign subsidiary.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nReference Rate Reform (ASC Topic 848\n\u201c\nASC 848\n\u201d\n)\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to provide optional relief for companies preparing for the discontinuation of interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and applies to lease and other contracts, hedging instruments, held-to-maturity debt securities and debt arrangements that reference LIBOR or another rate that is expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that makes amendments to the new rules on accounting for reference rate reform. The amendments clarify that for all derivative instruments affected by the changes to interest rates used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment, regardless of whether they reference LIBOR or another rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform, an entity may apply certain practical expedients in ASC 848.\nEffective for the Company\n\u2013 This guidance can be applied for a limited time through December 31, 2022. The guidance will no longer be available to apply after December 31, 2022.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nTHE EST\u00c9E LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpact on consolidated financial statements \u2013\nThe Company currently has an implementation team in place that is performing a comprehensive evaluation and assessing the impact of applying this guidance, which includes assessing the impact to business processes and internal controls over financial reporting and the related disclosure requirements. For treasury related arrangements, the Company references LIBOR in its interest rate swap agreements and LIBOR is also used for purposes of discounting certain foreign currency and interest rate forward contracts. 

[^bc61acce67ba884bf58761f184307c3c]: I will briefly cover the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results, followed by our thoughts on the outlook for fiscal 2023. Our fourth quarter organic net sales fell 8%, a bit better than we expected, reflecting the disruptions in China related to COVID restrictions, including travel retail in Hainan as well as the suspension of our commercial business in Russia and Ukraine. These matters more than offset continued growth from the recovery in the Americas and the rest of the EMEA region. Reported sales growth included approximately 1 percentage point from the addition of sales from DECIEM, while currency translation negatively impacted growth by approximately 3 percentage points. From a regional perspective, net sales in the Americas rose 9% organically led by double-digit increases in makeup and fragrance. 

[^f944757339f04620e6331ca78807f863]: NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE: EL) will release its fiscal 2023 second quarter results on February 2, 2023.

[^de55186f317dcb12f92bb00dc293865c]: Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 21% relative to 2 years ago. We delivered these excellent results while pushing our social impact and sustainability goals and commitment. First and foremost, we remain focused on employee and consumer safety and well-being.

Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if youd talk a little bit more about Asia-Pacific and the improvements there? And if you could talk about the drivers there? 

[^d20b0d354aef5585b348e59f1d6738bb]: Also Alibaba is present in different countries and we are collaborating with them in expanding the model in different countries, Lazada being probably the most evident example at this point to this expansion. We are playing with pure-play more and more, and we have many examples, particularly in Europe of this. And obviously, our retail.com continued to be expanded. And then in terms of our comfort with specialty-multi, I believe this is not new. We are very comfortable, and there is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with specialty-multi, we are doing well. 

[^dec6a7227357c621000187eb24a56aa]: Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Yes. So, I will start with the last, Andrea. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give specific market information.

Est\u00e9e Lauder launch last July of Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix has helped solidify the brand leadership in the eye treatment subcategory, which is a critical recruitment area in skin care. Our makeup sales were solid, but consumers demand is leveling off after several years of exceptionally strong growth. Our top performers were Est\u00e9e Lauder, M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Tom Ford. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brands gained share globally in makeup, largely driven by Double Wear foundation franchise. 

[^9e35ffb37df9f93f90770e419ebd9414]: And as I discussed a few minutes ago, we are expanding our consumer coverage in Mainland China.

Three compelling skincare innovation recently launched. Estee Lauders new advanced night repair eye matrix is focused on lines in every eyed zone, while La Mer De Hydrating Infused Emulsion is designed to replenish, strengthen, stabilize skin with healing moisture and has already proven to attract new consumers. 

[^e3fc3d957282bc036a73ea51233bd7fd]: For example, Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced a new eye serum under Advanced Night Repair line, the ANR Eye Concentrate Matrix. It was highly successful worldwide and helped drive sales of the entire franchise. Likewise, Clinique newest Moisture Surge product, a supercharged concentrate, boosted the collection and created the halo effect on the moisturizers sub-category, which is a strategic focus area for Clinique.

I think in the Investor Day, we demonstrated our success in new channels like online globally, Tmall, travel retail, specialty-multi globally is really happening and we are definitely capable to drive these brands.

[^faea5f4fe8c758b880aaae718a4e8d0a]: Inside, they’re just as modern. ALP believes in harnessing technology to differentiate its business and create value for its clients. Automation, including self-driving lifts and robots, helps power each futuristic facility. Cloud Technology Drives Value and Innovation The cloud is a cornerstone of ALP’s technology-inspired vision, and the business developed its core logistics platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The platform—running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (Amazon EKS)—includes systems to control warehouse management, inventory, execution of robotics within warehouses, and a client-facing order management system. 

[^aa8316f3efad3ee2aa9671a1a20d8335]: International expansion was on ALP’s agenda from the start and is the main reason they chose AWS. “AWS is an international company with a strong reputation in Taiwan and beyond. This makes us more credible with our target clients in new geographies,” says Nancy Cheng, marketing and public relations manager at ALP. The company has recently set up branch offices in Malaysia and Vietnam to bring its vision to more countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Seeking Updated Data to Support Decision-Making To support expansion and consolidate internal processes, ALP decided to implement SAP S/4HANA on AWS . 

[^cfd0d2525cbf1242cc4edfaaa2e832ab]: Together with AWS, EY suggested ALP implement three modules: SAP FICO (Finance and Controlling), SAP RE (Real Estate), and SAP PS (Project System). To support the SAP implementation, ALP is using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS), and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). EY also provided training to help upskill ALP’s employees in day-to-day SAP operations. By running SAP on AWS versus on premises, ALP estimates it’s saved hiring at least one employee dedicated to system and hardware maintenance. SAP upgrades and patches are rolled out automatically on the AWS Cloud, and the AWS services supporting SAP are likewise maintained by AWS teams. 

[^37f41d6e1a2f71b83b942b49e3babb86]: Benefits of AWS Shortens time to generate key financial reports Reduces manual effort for data collection and processing Improves accuracy and timeliness of data for management review Saves hiring 1 person to maintain systems and hardware Reduces complexity with consolidated storage and reporting Supports expansion with internationally recognized cloud foundation AWS Services Used SAP S/4HANA on AWS SAP customers can fully realize all the benefits of SAP S/4HANA in the AWS Cloud for systems of all sizes.

[^3bd986c49c2dd08ac64d3f60cb77bf87]: Ally Logistic Property Gains Timely, Accurate Data to Support Expansion with SAP S/4 HANA on AWS 2022 Ally Logistic Property (ALP) implemented SAP S/4HANA on AWS to streamline data processing and reduce the time and manual effort required for financial reporting. ALP is an institutional logistics property developer, operating six multi-warehouse logistics parks in Taiwan. The business is using Amazon EC2 for compute, Amazon EBS for storage, and Amazon VPC to support its SAP implementation. With the implementation of SAP on AWS, we’ve improved the accuracy, transparency, and timeliness of financial data."August Shiau VP of Administration, Ally Logistic Property Modern Warehouses Powered by Technology With rising income levels, Asia’s consumers are projected to be at the forefront of global consumption growth in the next decade.

[^b5379060fc4ae4e90aa038e548d3471c]: SAP RE, for example, serves as a central repository for all leasing contracts with ALP’s warehouse tenants, and shares data with SAP FICO to track each client transaction. “With the implementation of SAP on AWS, we’ve improved the accuracy, transparency, and timeliness of financial data. We can now devote more resources to serving our clients and performing business analysis rather than data collection,” Shiau says. Solid Foundation for Financial Reporting and Expansion Most significantly, the time required to generate reports has decreased. The speed and quality of A/R reports has particularly improved ALP’s cash flow, due to faster collection of receivables and the ability to consolidate multiple customers’ data according to custom filters. 

[^98b1cbbd85e90660f7c02e6075cd2e4f]: Reduced Manual Effort with Streamlined Data Processing Administrative complexity has also gone down with SAP on AWS. ALP maintains several large warehouse facilities across its six logistics parks in Taiwan, with each warehouse supporting 4 to 45 tenants. “It was very complex to manage all our different clients, each with a unique leasing contract. We had to put in a lot of manual effort,” says August Shiau, vice president of administration at ALP. Each of the SAP modules have contributed to streamlined data processing and a reduction in manual effort. 

[^c7caa255af102d8003e7a84dc8fde83e]: In addition, a security or data privacy breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations.
