**Sources:** Industry knowledge of Brazilian logistics market challenges; absence of recent news about the company in public sources

## CONCLUSION

PX Center presents an interesting opportunity in the Brazilian logistics technology sector with apparent strong growth from 2019-2021. However, limited public financial information and recent news create significant information gaps that would need to be addressed through direct engagement with the company to make a proper investment assessment.

**Recommendation:** Request direct engagement with company management to obtain current financial data, growth metrics, and business updates before proceeding with deeper investment consideration.
